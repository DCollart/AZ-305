# Cost optimization

## Discipline

Develop a cost model:
Ideation phase

    - Segment expenses
    - Estimate and forecast TCO

Estimate realistic budgets
Design phase

    - Budget all non-negotiable functional and non-functional requirements, personnel and training cost.
    - Set financial boundaries and allocate budget

Upstream communication

    - Costs are reduced when you act on feedback

## Mindset

Measure the workload design's total cost 

    - Return on investment (ROI)

Refine the design

    - Prioritize services that can reduce overall cost or don't need additional investment.

Design to support cost guardrails

    - Platform solutions, policies, infrastructure and application design pattern

## Design for usage optimization

Consumption-based pricing

- Only billed for the utilization
- Useful when only utilizeed sporadically

Optimize high availability design:

- Prioritize activate-active or active-only instead of active-passive

Keep environment clean of unused resources and data

- Decommission what's unused

## Rate optimization

Consolidate infrastructure where practical

- Co-locate usage with other resources, workload and even teams
- Prefer services that make it easier to achieve higher density
- As density increase the amount of resources needed to run a workload decrease

Take advantage of reservation and other infrastructure discount

- Committing and pre-purchasing to take advantage of discounts
- Work with licensing team to influence future purchase agreement programs and renewals

## Use fixed price billing when practical

- Switch to fixed price billing instead of consumption-based when utilization is high and predictable.

## Monitor and optimize over time

Continuously evaluate and optimized your environment and support costs

- Cost tacking system

Continuously review and refine workload

- Adjust architecture design/resources/code based on ROI data

Optimize your deployment environments

- Treat different SDLC env differently and deploy the right number of env.
