# Operational excellence
## Devops
- Community of practice and diversity
- Shared responsibility
- Clear lines of ownership/accountability to each team
- Optimize processes through technology
- Transparent communication

Collaborate efficiently

- Use common systems and tools that promote collaborative environment for communication and tracking progress

Continuous improvement

- Continuous learning minset throughout the development cycle
- Knowledge sharing across teams
- Maintain documentation for reuse
- Blameless analysis
- Debried post-release/incident

Codify developement and operations procedures

- Set standards for all dev/operational procedures
- Review those standards regularly

## Development standards

Adopt industry standards for development

- Shared backlog among all roles
- Give the team members clear expectations and accountability
-  Help with risk management with granular milestone review

Shift left for testing

- Have QA processes
- Test early in lifecycle
- Treat artifacts as immutable when they're promoted (gaining confidence)

Measure development efficience

- Report progress and trends to measure efficiency
- Track and report on trends in bugs/failed update/time to deploy

## Observability

- Improve quality by monitoring

Observe worload through telemetry

- Emit telemetry from application code that correlates the key points of the execution flow
- Prioritize actions based on the severity level

Visualize monitoring data in dasboard

- Aggregate and visualize data in dashboards
- Keep business context in mind

Design a robust alerting strategy

- Make alerts actionable by notifying the accountable roles

## Deploy with confidence

- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Treat IaC the same as your code

Standardize deployment on a single manifest

- Develop a common deployment manifest used across all env.

## Automate for efficiency

Automate flows

- Evaluate workflows against criteria:
- Complexity
- Effort
- Frequency
- Accuracy
- Timeliness
- Lifespan

Design for automation

- Design your components to support automation capabilities

Automation should be well-architected

- Treat automation as a critical dependency of your workload

## Safe deployment practices

Codify automated deployment standars

- Standardize the deployment processes

Deploy often

Use a progressive expose approach

 - Roll out update gradually
 - Gradually increase number of customer until the update is safely adopted
