# Security

## Plan your security readiness

Optmize security through segmentation

- Use segmentation as a strategy to plan security boundaries
- Should be driven by business requirements.

Respond to incidents efficiently

- Makesure there is an incident response plan

Codify secure operations and development practices

- Define and enforce team-level security standard across the lifecycle and operations.
- Consistent practices in operations like coding/gated approvals/release management and data protection and retention


## Design to protect confidentiality

Strictly limit access

- Implement strong access controls that grant access only on a need-to-know basis

Identify confidential data through classication

- Classify data based on its type/sensitivity/potential risk
- Assign a confidentiality level

Apply encryption at every step of the data lifecycle

-  Safeguard your data at rest/in transit/during processing by using encryption

## Design to protect integrity

Defend your supply chain

- Continuously protect against vulnerabilities and detect them in your supply chain.
- Vulnerabilities should be scanned during build time and runtime.

Employ strong cryptographic mechanisms

- Establish trust and verify by using cryptography techniques like code signin, certificates and encryption.
- Protect those mechanisms by allowing reputable decryption

Optimize the security of your backup

- Ensure backup data is immutable and encrypted
- WORM (Write Once Read Many)

## Design to protect availability

Enhance reliability through robust security

- Use security controls to prevent attack and code flaws from causing resource exhaustion and blocking access.

Proactively limit attack vectors

- Implement preventive measure for attack vector
- Code scanner
- Apply security pataches
- Update software

Secure your recovery strategy

## Sustain and evolve your security posture

Perform threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential threats

- Analyze each component of your workflow and evaluate potential threat
- Classify identified threats using an industry-standard methodology

Independently verify your controls

- Run periodic security tests conducted by experts external to the workload team who attempt to ethically hach the system.
- Perform routine and integrated vulnerability scanning

Get current and stay current

- Stay current on updates/patching/security fixes
- Continuously evaluate the system based on audit reports/benchmarking/...
- Consider automation.
