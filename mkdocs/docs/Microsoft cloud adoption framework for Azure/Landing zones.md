## Operating models 

### Decentralized

- Strategy priority: Innovation over control. Common in startup.
- Organization: Teams are organized around workload.
- Portfolio: Isolated to workload levels.
- Accountability: Workload team is accountable for operations/governance/security. No shared accountability.
- Standardization: Best practices and CI/CD are critical.
- Operation priority: Cloud first operations (SaaS/PaaS).
- Platform development velocity: Might share deployment script across workload but few or no resources shared.

### Centralized

- Strategy priority: When control/stability is more important than innovation. Highest trend.
- Organization: Teams are organized around functions/processes.
- Portfolio: One or small number of landing zones.
- Accountability: Central IT/Central operations are accountable for all assets in production.
- Standardization: High.
- Operation priority: 
- Platform development velocity: 

### Enterprise

- Strategy priority: Democratizing deisiosn and delegate responsabilities to balance innovation in some landing zones and tighter control in others.
- Organization: Build and operate capabilities in each workload team. Workload teams are aligned by function (governance, security, ...). Dedicated cloud center of excellence (CCoE) team unit the workload.
- Portfolio: 
- Accountability: CCoE team is responsible for maintaining the necessary centralized resources.
- Standardization: Highest.
- Operation priority: Cloud first.
- Platform development velocity: 

### Distributed

- Strategy priority: 
- Organization: 
- Portfolio: 
- Accountability: 
- Standardization: 
- Operation priority:
